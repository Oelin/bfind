bfind

Breadth-first search find for Linux.

The default traversal method for the find command is 
depth-first (DFS). This often results in long search 
times when the target file or directory isn't very 
deep below the current working directory. To address 
this problem, breadth-first search (BFS) can be used.

Usage: bfind | grep <some pattern>
